Wsp!!

I'm Azim (Saidazim Saidov), a Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate at UC San Diego (Class of 2026). With a strong foundation in programming languages like C, Python, and Java, along with proficiency in web development using HTML and CSS, I've developed versatile skills to create a wide range of projects. My current focus lies in the AI specialization and machine learning algorithms. I'm fascinated by their potential to revolutionize technology and drive innovation. Eager to contribute to this field, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge to real-world applications.  Whether it's through independent research, internships, or assisting on intriguing projects, I'm always ready to take on new challenges that expand my horizons. Feel free to connect with me for any discussions or potential collaborations.
