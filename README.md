Hey! My name is Saidazim Saidov, but I go by Azim.

I am a current undergraduate student at UC Riverside, class of 2027. I am studying Computer Science and have extensive knowledge of back- and front-end languages, including C, Python, Java,
HTML/CSS. I am currently learning the AI specialization and machine learning algorithm, and I am very interested in it as a possible career path.

I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my experience through research, internships, or assistant positions. Please reach out to me for any reason at all; I would love to chat!
